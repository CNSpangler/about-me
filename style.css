### Design Stretch Goals
- Apply additional styling to the page: try things like borders, alignment, margin, padding, and so on.
- Search for an online HTML validator and submit your code to it.
- Visit [this page](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference) and read about Chrome's built-in accessibility auditing tools. Following the instructions under the "View the contrast ratio of a text element in the Color Picker" heading, examine the contrast ratio values of your heading and paragraph tags. Modify your code until you can achieve a ratio that gets two check marks.
